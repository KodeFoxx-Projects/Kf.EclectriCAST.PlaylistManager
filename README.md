# KodeFoxx EclectriCAST Playlist Manager
<a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/dashboard/my-shows/published/" target="_blank"><img src="https://thumbnailer.mixcloud.com/unsafe/160x160/profile/b/1/c/e/a5e6-1b76-482c-ab82-beaf155a77eb" width="250" align="right"></a><p><i>TL;DR: this all boils down to playlist management software for my own show <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/dashboard/my-shows/published/" target="_blank">"The EclectriCAST"</a></i>.</p>
<p>The repository bundles several experiments to parse dj/mixtape type playlist data in various formats. A research into what would be needed to build out <a href="https://github.com/KodeFoxx-Projects/KodeFoxx.SimpleBroadcast" target="_blank">Simple Broadcast</a>. But, as of now, this thus is a project written primarily for myself and my own show <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/dashboard/my-shows/published/" target="_blank">The EclectriCAST</a>. But feel free to fork, clone or download the code - to either expand on it, transform it into something entirely different or just take ideas from it. I would appreciate if you'd contact me, as I could learn or improve my own workflow as well.</p>
